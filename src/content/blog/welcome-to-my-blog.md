Hi, I’m **Qiao Qian**—AI-curious engineer by day, code craftsman by night, and dad to two spirited daughters.  
This blog is my open lab notebook, a place to capture experiments, hard-won lessons, and the occasional aha moment. If you enjoy elegant solutions, deep dives, and a dash of real-world pragmatism, you’re in the right spot.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Hands-On Tech Notes** – PyTorch, Rust, Astro, and the graceful ways out of inevitable pitfalls  
- **AI Paper Tear-Downs** – Transformers, diffusion, flow-matching… translating dense math into intuitive stories  
- **Project Logs** – open-sourcing projects, interactive data viz, and STEM toys I build with my kids  
- **Life & Reflections** – bilingual parenting, and turning “compound interest” into a lifestyle

## Why Write?

Writing is **second-order thinking**. When an idea survives the trip from brain to keyboard, it’s finally clear—at least to me. I share to sharpen my own understanding and, hopefully, to light a few lanterns for fellow travelers.

## What’s Next

New posts should land roughly once a week (yes, that’s a public commitment).

See you in the next post! 🚀
