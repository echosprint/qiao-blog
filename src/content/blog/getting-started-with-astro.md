Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build fast websites using your favorite JavaScript frameworks. In this post, I'll share my experience with Astro and why I chose it for my blog.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several compelling features:
- Zero JavaScript by default
- Component-based architecture
- Support for multiple frameworks
- Built-in markdown support
- Excellent developer experience

## Key Features

### 1. Partial Hydration
Astro's partial hydration approach means you only send JavaScript when it's needed. This results in faster page loads and better performance.

### 2. Content Collections
With Astro's content collections, managing blog posts and other content is a breeze. You get type safety and a great authoring experience.
