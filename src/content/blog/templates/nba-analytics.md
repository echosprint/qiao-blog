## Impact on Player Valuation

### Traditional vs. Modern Scoring Value

```mermaid
pie title Points Distribution in MVP Seasons
    "2-Point FG" : 52
    "3-Point FG" : 38
    "Free Throws" : 10
```

## Statistical Analysis

### Correlation with Winning

The relationship between three-point shooting and win percentage:

```R
# R-squared: 0.72
model <- lm(win_pct ~ three_point_percentage + three_point_attempts)
```

Key findings:
1. Teams shooting >37% from three: 
   * Win percentage: .586
   * Playoff rate: 72%

2. Teams shooting <33% from three:
   * Win percentage: .421
   * Playoff rate: 28%

## Player Evolution

### Modern Shooting Splits

| Era | % of Points from 3 |
|-----|-------------------|
| 1980s| 5% |
| 1990s| 15% |
| 2000s| 22% |
| 2010s| 28% |
| 2020s| 36% |

## Strategic Implications

### Spacing Effect

    üèÄ  üèÄ                   üèÄ     üèÄ
```

## Training Evolution

Modern shooting practice routine:

1. Corner threes (100 shots)
   * Right corner: 50
   * Left corner: 50

2. Wing threes (100 shots)
   * Right wing: 50
   * Left wing: 50

3. Top of key (50 shots)

Total: 250 three-point attempts daily

## Future Projections

- [x] Shot selection
- [x] Quick release
- [ ] Off-ball movement
- [ ] Pick and pop skills

## Analytics Tools

Common tools used in NBA shot analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

def analyze_shooting(player_data):
    """
    Analyze player shooting patterns
    """
    return {
        'efg_pct': calculate_efg(player_data),
        'shot_value': expected_points(player_data),
        'hot_zones': identify_hot_zones(player_data)
    }
```

## Conclusion

The three-point revolution has fundamentally changed basketball:

1. **Spacing**: Defenses must extend further
2. **Skill Development**: Emphasis on shooting
3. **Team Building**: Shooters are premium
4. **Strategy**: New offensive schemes
5. **Player Evaluation**: Changed metrics
