## The Changing Role of the Developer

AI-assisted coding undeniably improves efficiency. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can generate boilerplate, fix bugs, and even write whole functions. But when this boost becomes widespread, it risks changing coding from a creative craft into something more mechanical—like an assembly line.

Programming used to be like craftsmanship. Engineers would think deeply about design, structure, and detail. Each solution was shaped with care and intention. But as AI evolves, much of that creative process is being automated. The developer’s role is shifting toward reviewing AI-generated code—or worse, reviewing the AI’s own review. It’s like installing bolts in a pipeline.

Yes, output increases. But the process becomes more tedious, less enjoyable. Even if you don’t lose your job—which is still a real risk—the nature of what remains may feel hollow. The work becomes more fragmented, more reactive. Developers may find themselves working in shifts just to keep up with machines that never tire, never sleep. You’re no longer working with AI—you’re working *for* it.

## The Loss of Autonomy

Another troubling shift is in how work is measured. With AI tools and integrated development platforms, everything you do becomes observable. Output is tracked, productivity is quantified, and performance can be supervised in real time.

This level of visibility turns software development into piecework: you're judged by the number of items produced, not the depth or value of your thinking. Stability, good compensation, and long-term growth begin to disappear. You're more easily outsourced, replaced, or discarded.

In this setup, AI becomes your silent manager—reporting on your output, flagging your performance, and pushing you to your limits just to keep your place. The job becomes exhausting, not inspiring.

## What Remains for Humans?

There’s still value in human judgment, domain knowledge, and creative problem-solving. But that space is shrinking. The meaningful, high-leverage parts of programming are being automated. What’s left may be less about building—and more about keeping pace.
